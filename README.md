# CommunityDetection
Finding betweenness of edges using Girvan Newman algorithm and finding the best communities using modularity calculation.

- Task 1 : Girvan Newman algorithm is used to find betweenness of each edge.
- Task 2 : The best communities are detected by deleting edges with maximum modularity and calculating the modularity of communities formed. The maximum value gives us the best communities.
- Task 3: community.best_partition() method is used to get the communities of the graph
